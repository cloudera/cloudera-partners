# AWS Enhancements

This directory contains AWS-specific enhancements to improve and extend your infrastructure. Currently, it includes modules for S3 bucket enhancements, such as applying lifecycle policies to automatically delete objects (e.g., logs) after a set period.

Additional AWS service enhancements may be added in the future.
