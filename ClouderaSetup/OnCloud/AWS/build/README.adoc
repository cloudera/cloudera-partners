== Overview

Hands-on Labs play a crucial role in showcasing the capabilities of Cloudera Data Platform Public Cloud form factor to partners and customers. They offer a practical and immersive learning experience that goes beyond a mere overview. Hands-on Labs facilitate participant engagement and allow them to explore and interact with different PaaS offerings of Cloudera Data Platform.

Infrastructure components are important and play a vital role in achieving the goal of Hands-on Labs and in providing a better experience to the participants.

**AutoClouderaDeploy** is a container-based solution that takes care of provisioning the required infrastructure components with minimal manual effort. By executing a single command, it creates a **disposable** on-demand stack consisting of:

1. Cloudera Environment
2. Datalake
3. Data Service (Currently CML, CDW & CDE)
4. `Keycloak` Server
5. Users


== Technology Stack
**AutoClouderaDeploy** employs a robust toolchain consisting of:

1. `Ansible`
2. `Terraform`
3. `Cloudera.cloud`
4. `CDP-tf-quickstarts`
5. `CDPY`
6. `CDP CLI`
7. `AWS CLI`
8. `Shell Scripting`

All the above tools are integrated with each other and packaged as a `Docker` Container for use.

== How To Create `Docker` Image for **AutoClouderaDeploy**

=== Step 1: Clone the Code and CD into the build Directory

[.shell]
----

cd ClouderaSetup/OnCloud/AWS/build/

----

---

=== Step 2: Build the Docker Image

[.shell]
----

# docker build . -t <reponame>/<imagename>:<tagname>
docker build . -t hol:latest

----
To verify the Docker image is actually created, check by image ID or Name:
[.shell]
----

docker images

----

---

=== Step 3: Log in to Docker Hub
The Docker image is available at Docker Hub. Once `Docker` is installed and ready to use, pull the **cdp-public-cloud-hol-provisioner:latest** image by executing the command below:

[.shell]
----

ksahu@Kuldeeps-MacBook-Air build % docker login
Log in with your Docker ID or email address to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com/ to create one.
You can log in with your password or a Personal Access Token (PAT). Using a limited-scope PAT grants better security and is required for organizations using SSO. Learn more at https://docs.docker.com/go/access-tokens/

=== Step 4: Tag and Push the Docker Image
The Docker image will be available at Docker Hub. Once `Docker` is installed and you are logged in to Docker Hub, push the **cdp-public-cloud-hol-provisioner:latest** image by executing the commands below:

[.shell]
----

docker tag hol:latest clouderapartners/cdp-public-cloud-hol-provisioner:latest
docker push clouderapartners/cdp-public-cloud-hol-provisioner:latest

----

---
Please note that the image built using the above method will be platform-dependent and may not work if you try to run the container on a different platform than the one it was originally built on. To build a platform-agnostic image, kindly refer to the link:

== Major Features Implemented in the CDP **AutoClouderaeploy** provisioner Automation for AWS:

1.  Ubuntu Linux-based base image.

2.  Optional provisioning of `Keycloak` Server for providing external user access to the Lab Environment with the help of SSO.

3.  When `Keycloak` Server is provisioned using this automation, the workshop owner can create the required number of workshop users with Keycloak (SSO) based access to the workshop environment (depending on the type of workshop e.g. CML, CDW, or CDE). The Keycloak server will be HTTPS (TLS/SSL Secured) with LetsEncrypt CA.

4.  Provisioned Keycloak users are added in the backend to IAM Groups in the CDP Tenant with the least required access roles.

5.  Assignment of required roles for workshop user access while deploying data services (Removed manual intervention).

6.  Externalize (parameterization from config file) the Keycloak Admin Password (for improved security control).

7.  Added below validation prerequisite checks for `AWS` and `CDP` infrastructures:
    -  Input config file is present.
    -  Required input parameter keys are present in the config file with non-empty values.
    -  Enough quotas for VPC, ElasticIP, and S3 bucket creation are available on AWS.
    -  Enough quotas for CDP IAM Users, IAM Groups, and SAML Identity Provider (IdP) creation are available on the CDP Tenant.

8.  Optional activation of CDW, CDE, and CML data services and provisioning of the required resources e.g. Virtual Service (CDE), Virtual Warehouses (CDW), Virtual Workspace (CML), etc.

9.  The automation is implemented in such a way that it can be retriggered with the provision or destroy command as needed.

10. The code uses Cloudera CDP-TF-Quickstart Terraform-based module and pulls the latest version dynamically at runtime.

11. Deployment of the number of CDW Warehouses is determined dynamically, based on the number of workshop users.

12. Optional deployment of GPU instances with CML workspaces.

13. Optionally override the various default configuration values for data services e.g. instance_type, instance_size, Spark version, etc. If you don't pass any override values, default values will be used.

14. Deployment of CDV instance and Data Catalog with CDW data service.

15. Decoupled Authentication Mechanism and provide multiple ways for authentication with `AWS`:

 a) ACCESS_KEY_ID and SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

 b) AWS SSO Mechanism via Octa/SAML

 c) Role Assignment to EC2 instance i.e. Deployer Machine. (via sts:assumeRole)
