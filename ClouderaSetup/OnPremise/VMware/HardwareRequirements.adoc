= Hardware Requirements

[NOTE]
====
Hardware specs (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) should be analyzed and re-determined based on the setup requirement, e.g., POC, demo, HA, DR, etc. The current setup is for POC/Demo purposes only.
====

Refer to the official Cloudera documentation for hardware requirements: https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud-base/7.1.9/installation/topics/cdpdc-requirements-supported-versions.html

== FreeIPA/Kerberos & Private DNS Server
[NOTE]
====
If FreeIPA is not used, an external Kerberos/KDC is required.

== PvC Base Cluster (6-node cluster on VMs)
[NOTE]
====
BaseMaster Node will also host Gateway and Utility hostsâ€™ services as per Cloudera documentation: https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud-base/7.1.9/installation/topics/cdpdc-runtime-cluster-hosts-role-assignments.html

Role assignment strategy for Control Plane Services (e.g., HDFS, YARN, Spark, etc.) is discussed in later steps.
