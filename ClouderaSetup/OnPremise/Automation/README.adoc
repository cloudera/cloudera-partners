Learn to effortlessly set up a single-node Cloudera on-premises cluster using automation.

TIP: Please read the entire article before starting the automation.

## Small Clusters, Big Impact: Where They Shine
* **Proof of Concept (PoC) Deployments** – Quickly showcase Cloudera’s capabilities to customers.
* **Software Integration** – Develop and test integrations with Cloudera’s platform (excluding performance validation and high availability testing).
* **Internal Testing & Development** – Experiment with configurations before full-scale deployment.
* **Hands-On Learning** – Gain practical experience with Cloudera’s capabilities.

## Setup Options
### #1. Deploying on a New VM

Automatically spins up a new VM in AWS and sets up a Cloudera cluster. 

**Pre-requisites** 

* Cloudera License – Log in to our https://cloudera-portal.force.com/clouderapartners[partner portal] to obtain the Cloudera on-premises license if you don’t already have one.
* Docker – Ensure Docker is installed and running on your computer.
* AWS Profile – Create an AWS profile using the AWS CLI.

**Installation Instructions**

* Clone the https://github.com/cloudera-labs/edge2ai-workshop[edge2ai-workshop] GitHub repository in your local machine.
* Follow the steps given in the https://github.com/cloudera-labs/edge2ai-workshop/tree/trunk/setup#setup[Setup section].
* Critical Steps:
  - Create stack.sh. Use `stack.cdp731p.sh` for Cloudera's latest unified runtime release. Feel free to remove any services you don't need, but make sure all https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud-base/7.3.1/cdp-private-cloud-base-installation/topics/cdpdc-service-dependencies.html[service dependencies] are properly handled.
  - Create .env._<namespace>_.
  - Launch the setup script (it internally uses Terraform to spin up AWS resources).
  - https://github.com/cloudera-labs/edge2ai-workshop/tree/trunk/setup#terminating-the-workshop-environment[Terminate] the cluster (shuts down the cluster and removes AWS resources).

### #2. Deploying on an Existing VM

Automatically sets up a Cloudera cluster on an existing VM.

**Pre-requisites**

* VM - Visit Cloudera https://supportmatrix.cloudera.com/[Support Matrix] to ensure you are using a Cloudera-supported OS version.
* Cloudera License – Log in to our https://cloudera-portal.force.com/clouderapartners[partner portal] to obtain the Cloudera on-premises license if you don’t already have one.
* Docker – Ensure Docker is installed and running on your VM.

**Installation Instructions**

* Clone the https://github.com/cloudera-labs/edge2ai-workshop[edge2ai-workshop] GitHub repository in your local machine.
* Follow the steps given in the https://github.com/cloudera-labs/edge2ai-workshop/tree/trunk/setup#deploying-on-an-existing-vm[Deploying on an existing VM section].
* Critical Steps:
  - Add your Cloudera license to /tmp/resources/.license before launching the setup script.
  - Choose the stack that you want to use. `cdp731p` is for Cloudera's latest unified runtime release. Feel free to remove any services you don't need, but make sure all https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud-base/7.3.1/cdp-private-cloud-base-installation/topics/cdpdc-service-dependencies.html[service dependencies] are properly handled. All the stack files are available in `setup/terraform/resources` directory.
* Want to terminate? Kill the VM or clean up resources manually before relaunching the automation.

**Additional Notes**

* This automation has been validated with: CentOS 7/8 (discontinued) and RHEL 7.x/8.x.
* RHEL 9.x Compatibility: Changes are required to make it work with RHEL 9.x – feel free to make those changes in the cloned project.

## Hardware Recommendation
This automation is typically run on instances with 16 vCPUs and 128 GB of memory. 

You may experiment with lighter instances, particularly if your stack file includes only a few services.

---

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting
* User file & directory permission issues - set umask to `022`.
* RHEL system registration issues -- refer to https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273[this] article for assistance.
* Unauthorized (HTTP 403) to download Cloudera parcels - ensure you've added your **active** Cloudera license.
* Insufficient AWS quota - Make sure you have enough AWS resources available for this automation. Example: if only 5 Elastic IPs are allowed and all are in use, either clean up unused resources or request a quota increase.

## Workshop Details
The edge2ai-workshop GitHub repository contains various https://github.com/cloudera-labs/edge2ai-workshop/tree/trunk?tab=readme-ov-file#workshops[workshops] to help you learn the Cloudera platform or demonstrate it to customers. Be sure to take advantage of these resources whenever possible.
