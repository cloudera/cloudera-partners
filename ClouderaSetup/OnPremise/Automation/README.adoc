# Fast-Track Your Single-Node Cloudera On-Premises Install

Learn to effortlessly set up a single-node Cloudera on-premises cluster using automation.

## Small Clusters, Big Impact: Where They Shine
- **Proof of Concept (PoC) Deployments** – Quickly showcase Cloudera’s capabilities to customers.
- **Software Integration** – Develop and test integrations with Cloudera’s platform (excluding performance validation and high availability testing).
- **Internal Testing & Development** – Experiment with configurations before full-scale deployment.
- **Hands-On Learning** – Gain practical experience with Cloudera’s capabilities.

## Setup Options
### 1. Deploying on a New VM

Automatically spins up a new VM(s) in AWS and sets up a Cloudera cluster. 

**Pre-requisites** 

- **Cloudera License** – Log in to our [partner portal](https://cloudera-portal.force.com/clouderapartners) to obtain the Cloudera on-premises license if you don’t already have one.
- **Docker** – Ensure Docker is installed and running on your computer.
- **AWS Profile** – Create an AWS profile using the AWS CLI.

**Installation Instructions**

- Clone the [edge2ai-workshop](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/edge2ai-workshop) GitHub repository in your local machine.
- Follow the steps given in the [Setup](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/edge2ai-workshop/tree/trunk/setup#setup).

  Key Highlights:

  - Create stack.sh. Use `stack.cdp731p.sh` for Cloudera's latest unified runtime release.
  - Create .env._<namespace>_.
  - Launch the setup script (uses Terraform to spin up AWS resources).
  - [Instructions](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/edge2ai-workshop/tree/trunk/setup#terminating-the-workshop-environment) to terminate the cluster (shuts down the cluster and removes AWS resources).

### 2. Deploying on an Existing VM

Automatically sets up a Cloudera cluster on an existing VM.

**Pre-requisites**

- **VM** - Ensure that your system is running a Cloudera-supported OS. Visit Cloudera [Support Matrix](https://supportmatrix.cloudera.com/) to ensure you are using a supported OS version.
- **Cloudera License** – Log in to our [partner portal](https://cloudera-portal.force.com/clouderapartners) to obtain the Cloudera on-premises license if you don’t already have one.
- **Docker** – Ensure Docker is installed and running on your VM.

**Installation Instructions**

- Clone the [edge2ai-workshop](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/edge2ai-workshop) GitHub repository in your local machine.
- Follow the steps given in the [Deploying on an existing VM](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/edge2ai-workshop/tree/trunk/setup#deploying-on-an-existing-vm).

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Add your Cloudera license to /tmp/resources/.license before launching the setup script.
    Choose the stack that you want to use. `cdp731p` is for Cloudera's latest unified runtime release.
- Want to terminate? Kill the VM or clean up resources manually before relaunching the automation.

**Additional Notes**

- This automation has been validated with: CentOS 7/8 (discontinued) and RHEL 7.x/8.x.
- RHEL 9.x Compatibility: Changes are required to make it work with RHEL 9.x – feel free to make those changes in the cloned project.
