## Useful to begin with Cloudera's stack primarily for:
* **Proof of Concept (PoC) and demo Deployments** â€“ Quickly showcase Clouderaâ€™s capabilities to customers.
* **Software Integration** â€“ Develop and test integrations with Clouderaâ€™s platform (excluding performance validation and high availability testing).
* **Internal Testing & Development** â€“ Experiment with configurations before full-scale deployment.
* **Hands-On Learning** â€“ Gain practical experience with Clouderaâ€™s capabilities.

## Setup Options
### Deploying on fresh set of VMs

Spin up new VMs on-premises or on AWS (or any other cloud, !!!not tested yet) and set up a Cloudera cluster. 

**Pre-requisites** 

* Cloudera License â€“ Log in to our https://cloudera-portal.force.com/clouderapartners[partner portal] to obtain the Cloudera on-premises license if you donâ€™t already have one.

**Installation Instructions**

* **ðŸ‘‰ link:./Cloudera_On-Premise_Deployment_Guide(ECS).pdf[Cloudera On-Premise Deployment Guide (ECS)]**

## Hardware Recommendation

You may experiment with lighter instances, particularly if your Cloudera deployment stack includes only a few services.

---

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting
* User file & directory permission issues - set umask to `022`.
* RHEL system registration issues - refer to https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273[this] article for assistance.
* Unauthorized (HTTP 403) to download Cloudera parcels - ensure you've added your **active** Cloudera license.
* Insufficient AWS quota - Make sure you have enough AWS resources available for this setup. Example: if only specific number of resources are allowed in a category and all are in use, either clean up unused resources or request a quota increase.
