    "Welcome to the 3th exercise in the Cloudera Agentic AI Hands on Lab. In this notebook you will get familiar the CrewAI library and how we can leverage it with Cloudera's AI Inference Service. This notebook is designed to walk you through the setup and application of these tools in an agentic worfklow context to create a robust and intelligence system. \n",

    "- **Configure AI Inference:** A private Meta LLama 3.1 8B model will serve as the backbone of our AI agents, providing the computational power and linguistic understanding necessary for processing complex queries.\n",
    "- **Set up CrewAI Agents and Tasks:** We will leverage the CrewAI library to set up our AI agents with clear roles, backstories and goals. We will also configure tasks for each agent to complete and identify tools that they can leverage to complete their tasks.\n",
    "- **Create Sequential Agentic Workflow:** Next, we will orchestrate these agents and tasks into a crew and workflow for them to complete.\n",
    "- **Running a Practical Example:** We will then run our example workflow by providing inputs for the agentic workflow to consider and then complete the tasks they are configured to do."
