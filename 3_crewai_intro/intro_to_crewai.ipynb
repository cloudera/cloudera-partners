This notebook is designed to walk you through the setup and application of these tools in an agentic worfklow context to create a robust and intelligence system. \n",

    "- **Set up CrewAI Agents and Tasks:** We will leverage the CrewAI library to set up our AI agents with clear roles, backstories and goals. We will also configure tasks for each agent to complete and identify tools that they can leverage to complete their tasks.\n",
    "- **Create Sequential Agentic Workflow:** Next, we will orchestrate these agents and tasks into a crew and workflow for them to complete.\n",
