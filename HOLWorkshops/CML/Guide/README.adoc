== Introduction

In this workshop, we will introduce you to the World Wide Telco organization. They have many ML use cases, but we’ll focus on a specific one for today. In this use case they are trying to reduce customer churn (i.e. cancellations) and most of the cancellations are coming in from their call center. In these hands-on labs, a customer, “Francisco” will call in with the intent to cancel. The call center application will - based on the predicted reasoning for Francisco to cancel - provide recommendations to Stefan who is the customer service manager for WW Telco. He’ll then provide the offer to Francisco will choose or not to choose to accept - i.e. not cancel his account.

Click on *Create Project*

On successful creation you should now see the project on your Project page

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="500" height="350" src="cml-media/media/image42.png">
</p>
++++

Clicking on it will take you to the Project that you just cloned from GitHub and you will be able to manage all the files from GitHub here.

++++


== Lab 1 - Data Ingest 

In this lab, you will work on the Data Ingest Stage.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="553" height="262" src="cml-media/media/image64.png">
</p>
++++


=== *Bootstrap Script*

We need to execute a bootstrap script at the start of the project. It will install the requirements, create the STORAGE environment variable and copy the data from raw/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn-.csv into /datalake/data/churn of the STORAGE location, on AWS it will s3a://[something], on Azure it will be abfs://[something] and on CDSW cluster, it will be hdfs://[something]

==== Step 1 : Create New Session

To create a new session you can go into your project and click on *New Session*


++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="350" src="cml-media/media/image65.png">
</p>
++++


Start a “*NEW SESSION*” and use the below configuration.

[width="100%",cols="21%,79%",]
|===
|*Session Name* |prep_data_ingest
|*Runtime Editor* |Workbench
|*Enable Spark* |Yes - Spark version 3.3.0  
|*Resource Profile* |2 vCPU / 4 GiB
|===

Click on *[.underline]#START SESSION#*

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="500" height="361" src="cml-media/media/prepdata.png">
</p>
++++

[IMPORTANT]
Please do not use the higher resource configurations.


On successful creation of the session you will get a Dialog box with a code snippet to connect to this session from an application. For now we can click on Close

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="367" height="256" src="cml-media/media/image66.png">
</p>
++++


==== Step 2 : Execute Bootstrap script

Once the session is ready you should get a similar message

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="445" height="222" src="cml-media/media/image30.png">
</p>
++++


Select the *0_bootstrap.py* under code on the left file browser

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="211" height="450" src="cml-media/media/pyfiles.png">
</p>
++++


Select *Run -> Rull All*
++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="356" height="222" src="cml-media/media/image18.png">
</p>
++++


As this will install all the dependencies and the first execution will take a bit tad longer as it needs to download all the binaries. You will start to see the execution logs on the right side of the screen.
++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="492" height="285" src="cml-media/media/image52.png">
</p>
++++

This execution will take a couple of minutes. The last command to be executed is this and post this the bootstrap step is completed, and you can move to the next step.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="548" height="325" src="cml-media/media/image1.png">
</p>
++++

=== Execute Data Ingest Script

In the same Workbench, open the script “_1_data_ingest.py_”

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="203" height="362" src="cml-media/media/image8.png">
</p>
++++

This script will load the data from an S3 bucket using Spark.

It demonstrates how to read from files and tables using Spark file and SQL operators.

Click on *Run → Run All.*

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="377" height="254" src="cml-media/media/image37.png">
</p>
++++

Session output will show the code execution results. Observe the database, table, and data from the table.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="700" height="400" src="cml-media/media/image73.png">
</p>
++++

Also examine the logs and Spark UI for details of the run. +
++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="354" src="cml-media/media/image68.png">
</p>
++++

Stop the session once you data ingestion completes

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="362" height="281" src="cml-media/media/image34.png">
</p>
++++

Go back to the Project page

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="484" height="234" src="cml-media/media/image57.png">
</p>
++++

== Lab 2 - Data Exploration 

In this lab, you will explore some dataset using a different editor from the previous lab.

In fact, in this lab we are going to use a popular notebook, Jupyter, to show the flexibility of CML that allows you to bring your own editor.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="445" height="239" src="cml-media/media/image38.png">
</p>
++++
=== Step 1 : Create New Session

To create a new session you can go into your project and click on *New Session*


++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="445" height="247" src="cml-media/media/image65.png">
</p>
++++

Start a “*NEW SESSION*” and use the below configuration.

[width="100%",cols="21%,79%",]
|===
|*Session Name* |data_explore
|*Runtime Editor* |JupyterLab
|*Enable Spark* |Yes - Spark version 3.3.0
|*Resource Profile* |2 vCPU / 4 GiB
|===

Click on *[.underline]#START SESSION#*

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="470" height="339" src="cml-media/media/dataexplore.png">
</p>
++++

==== Step 2 : Execute Data Exploration script

This Jupyter Notebook does some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization. It is to show how EDA fits into the data science workflow.
Double-Click on *2_data_exploration.ipynb* under code directory, it will take you into the notebook

You are ready to run the notebook, go to Run, Run All Cells

And you can analyze the plotted graphs

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="508" height="352" src="cml-media/media/image48.png">
</p>
++++


++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="513" height="288" src="cml-media/media/image27.png">
</p>
++++

Now we can go back to *Project*

This concludes this lab.


== Lab 3 - Model Build/Train Experiment 

In this lab, you will build and train the model, using the Experiment feature form CML that allows you to run offline different training sessions, with different parameters configuration, for your model so that you could promote in “Production” that configuration that showed the best results, KPIs.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="514" height="289" src="cml-media/media/image25.png">
</p>
++++

=== Model Building

==== Step 1 : Create Session

We will use a Jupyter Notebook to show the process of selecting and building the model to predict churn. It also shows more details on how the LIME model is created and a bit more on what LIME is actually doing.

To create a new session you can go into your project and click on *New Session*

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="428" height="247" src="cml-media/media/image65.png">
</p>
++++

Start a “*NEW SESSION*” and use the below configuration.

[width="100%",cols="21%,79%",]
|===
|*Session Name* |model_building
|*Runtime Editor* |JupyterLab
|*Enable Spark* |Yes - Spark version 3.3.0
|*Resource Profile* |2 vCPU / 4 GiB
|===

Click on *[.underline]#START SESSION#*

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="439" height="315" src="cml-media/media/model_building.png">
</p>
++++

==== Step 2 : Execute model building script

Double click on the _3_model_building.ipynb_ file under code directory .

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="462" src="cml-media/media/image60.png">
</p>
++++

At the top of the page click *Run > Run All Cells*.

Once the script finishes executing you can scroll to the bottom of the screen and check the part of the code where the built model is getting saved in pickle format.

image:cml-media/media/image17.png[cml-media/media/image17,width=624,height=134]

You can now see this pickle file created in your project directory as shown below.

image:cml-media/media/image79.png[cml-media/media/image79,width=299,height=366]

=== Model Training

The jobs feature in CML allows for adhoc, recurring, and dependency triggered jobs to run specific scripts. To run this model training process as a job, create a new job by going to the project window and clicking _Jobs > New Job_ (in the left side bar) and entering the following settings:

* **Name** : Train Model
* **Script** : 4_train_models.py
* **Arguments** : _Leave blank_
* **Schedule** : Manual
* **Enable Spark**:Yes - Spark version 3.3.0
* **Resource Profile** : 2 vCPU / 4 GiB

image:cml-media/media/cml_job1.png[cml-media/media/cml_job1,width=600,height=500]

image:cml-media/media/cml_job2.png[cml-media/media/cml_job2,width=600,height=366]

The rest can be left as is. Once the job has been created, click **Run** to start a manual run for that job.

== Lab 4 - Model Deploy/Serve 

In this lab, you will deploy/serve the model that you have trained in the Lab 3 as a REST endpoint. The model can be invoked as-needed, in real-time or batch fashion, by external services that need to score the prediction implemented by the model.

image:cml-media/media/image9.png[cml-media/media/image9,width=624,height=350] +

image:cml-media/media/image62.png[cml-media/media/image62,width=624,height=350]

Click on *_Files_* in the left tab, and go to the file *_5_model_serve_explainer.py_*:

image:cml-media/media/image75.png[cml-media/media/image75,width=624,height=290]

This is the script for serving the model, and the line below is loading the pickel model we have generated in the Lab 3

image:cml-media/media/explainer1.png[cml-media/media/explainer1,width=400,height=30]

and the function is the one that takes the input arguments, passes them to the model for scoring and gives back the result of the score.

image:cml-media/media/explainer2.png[cml-media/media/explainer2,width=350,height=135]

Copy the entire string as shown below because we are going to use it in the future and a sample JSON input parameters for the model.

[source,json]
----
{"StreamingTV":"No","MonthlyCharges":70.35,"PhoneService":"No","PaperlessBilling":"No","Partner":"No","OnlineBackup":"No","gender":"Female","Contract":"Month-to-month","TotalCharges":1397.475,"StreamingMovies":"No","DeviceProtection":"No","PaymentMethod":"Bank transfer (automatic)","tenure":29,"Dependents":"No","OnlineSecurity":"No","MultipleLines":"No","InternetService":"DSL","SeniorCitizen":"No","TechSupport":"No"}
----

Now go to *_Model Deployments_*

image:cml-media/media/image61.png[cml-media/media/image61,width=126,height=307]

Click *_New Model_*

image:cml-media/media/image59.png[cml-media/media/image59,width=550,height=250]

Enter the following details

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|*Deployment Template* |Deploy Model from Code
|*Name* |<workload_username>_telco_churn_mod
|*Description* |Deploying the telco churn model
|*Enable Authentication* |*False (Disable)*
|*File* |code/5_model_serve_explainer.py
|*Function* |explain
|*Example Input* |{"StreamingTV":"No","MonthlyCharges":70.35,"PhoneService":"No","PaperlessBilling":"No","Partner":"No","OnlineBackup":"No","gender":"Female","Contract":"Month-to-month","TotalCharges":1397.475,"StreamingMovies":"No","DeviceProtection":"No","PaymentMethod":"Bank transfer (automatic)","tenure":29,"Dependents":"No","OnlineSecurity":"No","MultipleLines":"No","InternetService":"DSL","SeniorCitizen":"No","TechSupport":"No"}
|*Runtime Editor* |Workench
|*Enable Spark* |TRUE - Spark 3.3.0
|*Resource Profile* |2 vCPU / 4 GiB
|===

image:cml-media/media/modeldeploy1.png[cml-media/media/image85,width=550,height=398]

image:cml-media/media/modeldeploy2.png[cml-media/media/image86,width=550,height=433]

image:cml-media/media/modeldeploy3.png[cml-media/media/image29,width=550,height=300]

At this point you can deploy the model by clicking *_Deploy model_*

image:cml-media/media/image32.png[cml-media/media/image32,width=700,height=250]

The status will go thru the life-cycle of the container _Pending_ -> _Building_

image:cml-media/media/image36.png[cml-media/media/image36,width=550,height=220]

_Building_ -> _Deploying_

image:cml-media/media/image46.png[cml-media/media/image46,width=550,height=220]

And finally _Deployed_

image:cml-media/media/image41.png[cml-media/media/image41,width=550,height=220]

Now you can click on the model name and test it ...

image:cml-media/media/image40.png[cml-media/media/image40,width=472,height=229]

… you should get the following:

image:cml-media/media/image45.png[cml-media/media/image45,width=624,height=100]

If you want to call the model from external services, the sample codes for invoking this REST endpoint are provided in Shell, Python and R

image:cml-media/media/image44.png[cml-media/media/image44,width=624,height=93]

As you can see the sample codes also provide an _accesskey_ for invoking this model, so only the services that provide a correct _accesskey_ can invoke it. You can manage the access key by going to *_Settings_*:

image:cml-media/media/image47.png[cml-media/media/image47,width=536,height=436]

Copy the Access Key for the next lab

image:cml-media/media/image31.png[cml-media/media/image31,width=624,height=129]

The model can be monitored going to the *_Monitoring_* tab

image:cml-media/media/monitoring.png[cml-media/media/monitoring,width=624,height=294]

This concludes this lab.

== Lab 5 - Application Deploy 

In this lab, you will create an application that embeds the model deployed in the previous lab, allowing business users, end-users that are not Data Scientists to interact and to get insight about the context of these analyses.

image:cml-media/media/image16.png[cml-media/media/image16,width=351,height=197]

In the left tab, go to *_Applications_*

image:cml-media/media/image14.png[cml-media/media/image14,width=135,height=309]

And as you can see we do not have any applications available yet. Go back to Files, here you can see that we provide the code on an application that is a Flask application as front-end

And the back-end is provided by the 6_application.py code

And now update the access key in the *single_view.html* (this file is under the *flask* folder)

image:cml-media/media/image58.png[cml-media/media/image58,width=501,height=433]

Click on *single_view.html* and you can see the accesskey that we need to substitute to the one we copied in the previous lab

image:cml-media/media/image3.png[cml-media/media/image3,width=624,height=412]

In order to edit this file, open it in a workbench (click Open in Session)

image:cml-media/media/image23.png[cml-media/media/image23,width=700,height=300]

You do not need to launch a session. Just substitute the access key with yours and select *File > Save*.

image:cml-media/media/image21.png[cml-media/media/image21,width=618,height=168]

This is going to be used to call our deployed model when the end-user of this application will interact with it.

Now go back to Application, and click the New Application button.

image:cml-media/media/image84.png[cml-media/media/image84,width=624,height=336]

Provide the following details.

[width="100%",cols="24%,76%",]
|===
|*Name* |<username>_telco_churn_app
|*Subdomain* |<username>telco
|*Description* |Application that leverages the built model
|*Script* |6_application.py
|*Runtime - Editor* |Workbench
|*Enable Spark* |TRUE - Spark 3.3.0
|*Resource Profile* |2 vCPU / 4 GiB
|===

image:cml-media/media/App1.png[cml-media/media/App1,width=389,height=501]

image:cml-media/media/app2.png[cml-media/media/app2,width=389,height=350]

And then click *Create Application*

Then you should see the status *Starting* state

image:cml-media/media/image35.png[cml-media/media/image35,width=624,height=450]

After a while it will change to *Running*

image:cml-media/media/image11.png[cml-media/media/image11,width=466,height=196]

Click now in your newly created application

image:cml-media/media/image80.png[cml-media/media/image80,width=362,height=185]

You can see the subdomain we have specified before as a prefix of your application url.

image:cml-media/media/image4.png[cml-media/media/image4,width=624,height=142]

Once the application is loaded

image:cml-media/media/image6.png[cml-media/media/image6,width=624,height=113]

Click on one of the item in the Probability column

image:cml-media/media/image7.png[cml-media/media/image7,width=212,height=372]

To get the detailed view

image:cml-media/media/image5.png[cml-media/media/image5,width=624,height=681]

If you change some of the values, that will also change the churn probability by calling the model we have deployed in the previous lab.

image:cml-media/media/image15.png[cml-media/media/image15,width=624,height=681]

Everytime you click and change a value, the application will call our model. To check this go back to your model deployed, click Monitoring bd you should see that the Receive value is increased

image:cml-media/media/increase.png[cml-media/media/increase,width=1000,height=216]

This concludes the lab.
