== Introduction

This document aims to introduce to our partners the features of *CDE*, the Data Engineering Data Service of Cloudera Data Platform (*CDP*). During the course of this workshop,you will experience how simple it is to run and orchestrate spark jobs with the help of auto-scaling infrastructure. We will use Airflow for orchestrating the various jobs.
