=== Cloning This Repository with Submodules

This repository uses Git *submodules* to manage multiple projects. Depending on your workflow, follow the instructions below:

==== 1. Clone the entire repository with all submodules
If you want everything (main repo + all submodules in one go):

[source,bash]
----
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cloudera/cloudera-partners.git
----

If you already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, you can fetch submodules with:

[source,bash]
----
git submodule update --init --recursive
----

==== 2. Clone only a single submodule (folder)
If you only want to work on a specific submodule without cloning the entire repo:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/cloudera/<submodule-repo>.git
----

Example (replace `<submodule-repo>` with the actual submodule name):

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/cloudera/End2EndLabs.git
----

==== 3. Clone the main repo, then initialize submodules later
If you want to start with just the main repo and then pull submodules as needed:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/cloudera/cloudera-partners.git
cd cloudera-partners

# Initialize submodules (but donâ€™t fetch yet)
git submodule init

# Fetch a specific submodule
git submodule update -- End2EndLabs

# Or fetch all submodules
git submodule update --recursive
----

==== Pro tip
If submodules ever get out of sync, resync them with:

[source,bash]
----
git submodule sync --recursive
----
